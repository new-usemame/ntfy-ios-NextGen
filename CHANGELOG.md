# Changelog

User-facing release notes for **NTFY me - Next Gen** (ntfy iOS NextGen). These are the notes that go
into the App Store "What's New" field. Engineering detail and upstream tracking live in
`CHANGES-vs-upstream.md`.

## Unreleased

- Reading or dismissing notifications on a self-hosted topic now requests a silent wake for your
  other devices, so they can clear those notifications in the background. Background delivery is
  best effort; opening the app still catches up when a wake is delayed.
- Deleting a message, a selection, or a topic's message history also asks the server to delete those
  messages for other clients. Read-only subscriptions and older servers keep the local action.

- Settings → About → Licenses lists the open-source licenses the app is built on.

## 1.15.0

- Topics that were set up on the old built-in server now move to ntfy-me.com automatically, so they
  start receiving notifications again. Topics on a server you have signed in to are left as they are.
  A one-time notice lists the moved topics and the address to send to now.
- **End-to-end encrypted topics.** Give a topic a password and messages sent with it are encrypted
  in transit and on the server; the server, Google and Apple see only ciphertext. Once they arrive
  they are stored readable on this device, like any other notification. The app shows ready-to-copy
  Node.js and Python senders for the topic, and "Send test notification" sends an encrypted test.
  Messages that arrive before you set the password show as "Encrypted message" and open once you do.
- **Easier first topic.** Tap Random for a hard-to-guess topic name, and see the address to send to
  before you subscribe. A new topic opens straight away with ready-to-copy `curl` commands (plain, and
  with a title and high priority) and its full `https://` publish URL; "Copy publish URL" is also in the
  topic menu. On a server you have signed in to, the commands use your user name and curl asks for the
  password, so it is never in the copied text.
- **Notification permission is asked at the right time.** The app no longer asks on first launch.
  After you add your first topic, a short screen explains why, then iOS asks. "Not now" is remembered.
- **Messages show up while a topic is open**, even without notification permission. The open topic
  checks for new messages every 10 seconds and when you return to the app, and pull to refresh now
  works on an empty topic.
- Help links now point to the quick start at ntfy-me.com; the ntfy documentation is still in Settings
  as the full reference.

## 1.14.0

- **New default server: ntfy-me.com.** The app now works out of the box: new topics use ntfy-me.com,
  a free public ntfy server run by the app's publisher. It is not affiliated with
  ntfy.sh or the ntfy project. Any ntfy server still works — change it in Settings or per topic.
- **Push notifications carry no message text.** Google and Apple see only the topic name and a message
  ID; the app fetches the message itself from the server over an encrypted connection.
- **Self-hosting?** Add `upstream-base-url: "https://ntfy-me.com"` to your server config to get
  instant push in this app.
- Existing subscriptions are moved to the right push channels automatically on first launch after the
  update.
- Updated Privacy Policy: ntfy-me.com keeps messages for 12 hours and attachments for 3 hours, and uses
  IP addresses for rate limiting.
