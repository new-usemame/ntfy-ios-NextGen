# Changes vs upstream (binwiederhier/ntfy-ios)

Fork-original changes and backports that diverge from the `binwiederhier/ntfy-ios`
base, so we can track what to (eventually) upstream and what shipped when.

| Date | Change | Kind | ntfy issue | PR | sha | Release |
|------|--------|------|-----------|----|-----|---------|
| 2026-07-04 | Add `ntfyTests` unit-test target (host-based) + 4 seed tests; make app launchable under XCTest (guarded Firebase/push + Core Data in-memory) | infra/test | — | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2026-07-08 | Linkify bare URLs inside `text/markdown` messages (markdown parser only links `[text](url)`/`<url>`, so bare `https://…` was tappable as plain text but dead as markdown) — completes #1072 markdown + #1743 links | fix | [#1072](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/1072) | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2026-07-12 | Honor ntfy's action `clear` flag: tapping an action with `clear: true` now dismisses the delivered notification (the field was parsed but never read) — visible feedback for remote-approval buttons ([ntfy-ios#38](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-ios/pull/38), @abreparentesis) | fix | [ntfy#1728](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/1728) | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2026-07-14 | Resolve every gemoji alias, not just the first: `EmojiManager` indexed only `aliases.first`, so 43 aliases the ntfy web/Android clients accept (`thumbsup`, `poop`, `uk`, `telephone`, …) rendered as literal text instead of emoji | fix | — | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2026-07-15 | Title notifications with the subscription's custom display name: a renamed subscription showed its custom name in the subscription list and notification header, but titleless push/local notifications still showed the raw `ntfy.sh/topic` (the Android client honors the rename via `formatTitle`→`displayName`) | fix | — | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Change | ntfy issue | Upstream PR | Fork PR | SHA | Release |
| Custom display names for subscriptions | [#1314](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/1314) | [ntfy-ios#29](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-ios/pull/29) (AnimaI) | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Rebrand to ntfy NextGen: bundle id `io.heckel.ntfy`→`com.legitimateapps.ntfynextgen`, app group, display name, team→3LTL47SJ8C (Legitimate LLC) | — | — | TBD | TBD | TBD |
