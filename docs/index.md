# NTFY me (ntfy iOS NextGen)

Get a push notification on your iPhone or iPad from any computer, script, server or cron job with one
HTTP request. NTFY me is an actively maintained iOS app for [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh), the open-source
push-notification service, forked from
[binwiederhier/ntfy-ios](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-ios) (MIT). It's free on the App Store as
[NTFY me - Next Gen](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id6787782178). It is not affiliated with or endorsed
by the ntfy project.

```sh
# Subscribe to a topic in the app, then from any terminal:
curl -d "Backup finished" https://ntfy-me.com/your-secret-topic
```

No account or API key: the topic name is the password, so pick a long random one.

## Common questions

**How do I get a notification on my phone when a script or long command finishes?**
Install the app, subscribe to a long random topic on ntfy-me.com, and add
`curl -d "done" https://ntfy-me.com/<topic>` to the end of the script (or `long-command; curl -d "exit $?" https://ntfy-me.com/<topic>`).
Recipes for Windows PowerShell, Python, cron, GitHub Actions and Home Assistant are on [ntfy-me.com](https://ntfy-me.com).

**How is NTFY me different from the official ntfy iOS app?**
Both speak the ntfy protocol. NTFY me is a fork that ships frequent updates. It adds end-to-end
encrypted topics, pinned topics, display names, a guided first-run setup with copy-ready commands,
and many reliability fixes from ntfy's iOS issue backlog. See the
[changelog](https://github.com/new-usemame/ntfy-ios-NextGen/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

**Does it work with ntfy.sh or my own server?**
Any ntfy server works. Self-hosted servers get instant push by setting
`upstream-base-url: "https://ntfy-me.com"`. Topics on ntfy.sh arrive without instant banners (ntfy.sh
relays iOS push only to the official app), so for instant banners use ntfy-me.com or your own server.

**Is it free? Do I need an account?**
Yes, it's free, and no account is needed. ntfy-me.com keeps messages for 12 hours. Push notifications
carry no message text; the app fetches each message from the server over TLS.
